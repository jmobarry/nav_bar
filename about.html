    Dune (titled onscreen as Dune: Part One) is a 2021 American epic science fiction film directed by Denis Villeneuve with a screenplay by Jon Spaihts, Villeneuve, and Eric Roth. It is the first of a planned two-part adaptation of the 1965 novel of the same name by Frank Herbert, primarily covering the first half of the book. Set in the far future, it follows Paul Atreides as he and his family, the noble House Atreides, are thrust into a war for the dangerous desert planet Arrakis.

    Following a failed attempt by Paramount Pictures to produce a new adaptation of Herbert's novel, Legendary Entertainment acquired film and TV rights to Dune in 2017. Development began shortly after, with Villeneuve expressing interest in the project and officially signing as director in January 2017. He worked with Roth and Spaihts on the screenplay, breaking the 1965 novel's adaption into two parts and incorporating an updated 21st-century sensibility atop Herbert's original visions. Similar to the two-part It from 2017, production contracts were secured only for the first part of the script, with anticipation that the second part would be greenlit with a successful box office performance of the first part. Filming took place from March to July 2019 at various locations, including Budapest, Jordan, Norway and Abu Dhabi.
