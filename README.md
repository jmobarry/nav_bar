Title: Nav Bar

Description: This exercise uses babel and react to create a SPA for the currently released theatrical movie DUNE.

How To Run: go to https://jmobarry.github.io/nav_bar/ and click the buttons on the nav bar to see information.

Roadmap: In the future I would like to update my page so that I can return to the homepage with the DUNE poster without page refresh. (Was able to implement this)
